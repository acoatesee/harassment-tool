According to the Occupational Health and Safety Act, an employer shall ensure that an investigation is conducted that is appropriate in the circumstances. This is important to both employers and employees since failure to conduct a fair and neutral investigation process could lead to damages, another investigation being ordered, or setting aside the employerâ€™s sanctions. This questionnaire will show you whether your investigation has potential flaws and will flag any flaws at the end."}
